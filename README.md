 # Project analyses/details: 

My “Music playlist app” App is a mobile application produced and developed for the Introduction to Mobile Application assignment (IMAD). The app's Primary objective is to store song details as well as allow users to create and manage playlists.the app should be able to provide the user with the service of being able to rate songs, add comments as well as add input information about the artists. 

My application was created according to the specifications and requirements of the assignment, requirements being that GitHub is used for version control and CI/CD automation through GitHub Actions, as well as a successful creation of a fully functional App. 

 

 

Features and Objectives of the App: 

 

App Objective: 

The main Objective of this mobile app is to create manageable like environment and assist the user to store music in an orderly manner. 

 

Key Features: 

- the application generates songs based on the input of the user and allows the user to comment and rate the artist as well as the music provided.  

-the app does not give feedback for input provided that does not coinside with the structure of how the app should be used. 

- the app is easy to use and because of that it is beneficial to download. 

 

# Design Elements 

The design of the app was based on: 

 

1. User Experience: The mobile app is designed with the objective to provide an easy-to-navigate user interface, ensuring an easy-to-use user interaction. 

    

2. Responsiveness: The app was built to ensure it performs well in terms of device compatibility on different screen and or cellphone providers such as android and or apple. 

    

3. Simplicity: The design is modest and simple , focusing on specific and straight to the point features without overwhelming the user. 

    

4. Performance: Code maximisation and optimization was bear in mind to Guarantee fast response times as well as low battery usage as not much coding is used that would result in drastic usage or battery drainage . 

 

 

# GitHub and GitHub Actions Use 

 

This mobile application was managed using GitHub for version control, where majority code changes are pushed regularly. GitHub allowed me to keep track of possible changes as well as maintain project validity.

#Challenges and Learnings 

 

Throughout the course of the development of the app, I experienced a few challenges, being the following: 

 

First challenge was working out a way to push my code as the way we were taught gave me struggles to find a Solution. –i managed to get my Code as well as readme to both github as well as my arc platform. 

    

2nd Challenge: My code seemed to not have any complicated logical problems which resulted in my app not being able to run ,even though i managed to stress all resources to find the issue my code seems right to me even though there is an obvious error that is stopping me from being able to fully run my code with no crashes or errors at all. 

Solution – I made use of all resources available to use .as well as seeked help from a staff member to push my code and read me file onto GitHub. 

 

#Future Improvements 

 

Even though the current version of the application provides logcial issue in terms of function there are many improvements that can be included in the future, including: 

 

Improvement 1: allowing users to search through a larger variety of songs as well as artists instead of being limited to a certain number. Improvement 2: seek prioir assistance for my code in terms of function and brining hypothetical issues i may have faced and found a solution prior. As well as researching other ways to upload content onto GitHub to avoid an issue if one would not work. 

Why: 

- Suggesting future improvements shows forward thinking and a desire to gradually improve your work as well as coding and problem-solving skills . It also demonstrates that the coder / student has a clear vision for the app beyond the current assignment.
